# Sentence similarity techniques for short vs variable-length text using Word Embeddings
In open-domain Conversational agents like Chatbots, finding the similarity between predefined text per action and user input of variable-length is a hard NLP problem.

We are publishing this dataset related to shopping domain to build Conversational agents. Extensive experiments on the dataset achieved improvement of 6% in accuracy, 2% in precision and 80% in recall in Classification task based on the existing sentence similarity techniques.
